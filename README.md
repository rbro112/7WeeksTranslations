# 7 Weeks Translations
Strings and text available to be translated for 7 Weeks Android

Please email me before translating!

I can be reached at [ryan.brooks@7weeksapp.com](mailto:ryan.brooks@7weeksapp.com) and I'll reply to your email as quickly as I can.

### How to translate
1. Fork this repository or download the files directly if you are unfamiliar with Git.

2. For all translations, create a copy file of the English translation. Name this file [ORIGINAL FILE NAME]_[YOUR LANGUAGE]. So for example if I was translating ```strings.xml``` to Chinese, the new file would be called ```strings_chinese.xml```.

3. Translate all files and text as you wish. Please pay attention to proper grammar and vocabulary in your translations. If there are differences that require clarification, please don't hesitate to let me know.

**If a translation involves profanity or is crude in any wayin your language, please let me know. We will find a way to re-word it!**

4. Either open up a new Pull Request if you used git and I will review the changes before accepting the translations. If you downloaded the files, email me the new files and I will add them once reviewed!

Thanks so much for translating!

Have you been trying to make/break a habit or set a goal for yourself? Have you been struggling to get started or motivated to change your life, but just can't seem to get around to it?

Luckily for you, 

All it takes is 7 Weeks!

7 Weeks is the simplest way to develop a new habit or goal or break a bad habit. Based on Charles Duhigg's bestselling book, "The Power of Habit" and the X effect method of completing goals, 7 Weeks combines the two and creates an ultra simple strategy of completing one day of your habit/goal at a time. Every day that you complete successfully, simply mark the day as complete! Each day you complete gets you one step closer to not just making or breaking a new habit or completing a goal, but it increases your motivation, willpower and discipline.

Scientists believe the sweet spot for developing a habit is right around 7 Weeks, so once you have completed 49 days straight with little failure, you can be sure you'll have developed a positive habit, broken a bad habit or completed a goal.

With custom alarms, a beautiful material design interface and multiple customization options for each habit/goal, 7 Weeks is the best app to get you on track to making your habits and goals.
